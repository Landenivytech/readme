SnoutScheduler
This is Group Four's Final project for SDEV220. We are creating an appointment manager program named Snout Scheduler, which will be used by Paws & Relax Grooming, a pet grooming business. This application enables customers to schedule grooming appointments for their pets according to the availability of the groomer. It also allows customers to have more than one pet. You can set up what you want to get for your pet, like haircuts and baths. It also checks if the groomer is available or not. It can also find open slots and today's open slots. You are also able to cancel appointments, and you can get today's schedule, which also allows you to see the schedule.
